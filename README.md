# First-project-in-second-semester-


# After completing my first semester in computer science, I started solving a problem that I observed in my surroundings. In our country, some departments are still working manually. I gathered information about the problem and how to solve it. After understanding the basics, I combined the knowledge I had gained in my first and second semesters. Initially, I solved the problem in a file that worked only in the terminal. Afterward, I modified it using OOP and got good results. I separated the file into 3 or 4 parts for better understanding and called all the methods or functions into the main file. I also designed a rough GUI for this. I know it requires many changes, but at this stage, I applied my entire knowledge.
